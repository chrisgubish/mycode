Learning to read in files. This lab uses the following methods:

    .read() - return the file's contents as a string
    .readlines() - return the file's lines as a list
    .seek() - move the cursor around an open file"""

def main():


    ######## EXPLORE READ ##########
    ## create file object in "r"ead mode
    configfile = open("vlanconfig.cfg", "r")

    ## display file to the screen - .read()
    print(configfile.read())

    # the "cursor" is now at the end of the file
    # we COULD close the file and reopen it to
    # move the cursor back to the top of the file


    ## close file
    #configfile.close()
    ## re-create file object to explore new method
    #configfile = open("vlanconfig.cfg", "r")

    # alternatively we can use the method '.seek'
    # this will move the cursosr back to position 0,0
    # or the start of the file
    configfile.seek(0, 0)




    ######## EXPLORE READLINES ###########
    ## make a list of file lines - .readlines()
    configlist = configfile.readlines()
    print(configlist)

    ## Iterate through configlist
    for x in configlist:
        print(x.strip())      ## by default .strip will remove any whitestpace or newline characters
                              ## therefore we no longer want to change "end=" from its default setting of 
                              ## a newline character


        ## Always close your file
        configfile.close()
